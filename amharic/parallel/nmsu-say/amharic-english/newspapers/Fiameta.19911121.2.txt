The priest monk said he's looking for a work as a driver of a taxi as the door of the clergy was closed for him!

   ካህኑ ከልጅነት ሕይወታቸው ጀምሮ በቤተ-ክርስቲያኗ ውስጥ ያደጉና ከዲቁና እስከ ቅስና ከመንኩስና እስከ ቁምስና የደረሱ ፣ ቤተ-ክርስቲያንን በተለያየ መንፈሳዊ ኃላፊነት ያገለገሉ ሲሆን ፣ ከቅርብ ጊዜ ወዲህ ግን የቤተ-ክህነት በር ተዘግቶባቸው ከሥራም ሆነ ከደመወዝ በመፈናቀላቸው ምክንያት የሹፍርና ሥራ ታክሲም ቢሆን እያፈላለጉ መሆናቸውን ገልፀዋል።

The Priest used to grow up in the church from childhood on wards, from deaconhood to priesthood, from monkhood to abbacy; served the church in various spiritual responsibilities, but as of recently, the door of the clergy has been closed upon him and he is not given salary and dismissed from work, so he's looking for a job, even if it was driving a taxi, he explained.

   ስማቸው እንዲገለፅ ያልፈለጉት እኚህ አባት (የካህን መነኩሴ) እንዱሉት ከሆነ በደረሰባቸው እንግልት ምክንያት ለፓትርያርኩ በተደጋጋሚ አቤቱታዎችን አቅርበው ፍትሕ በማጣታቸው የተነሳ ባላቸው የመንጃ ፈቃድ የሾፍርነቱን ሥራ ለማፈላለግ ግድ እንደሆነባቸው ተናግረዋል። 

A father whose name wanted to remain anonymous (a priest monk) said that he appealed to the patriarch repeatedly for he was sick and tired of the ups and downs, but that was also of no avail, and since he has a driving license, he is at present obliged to look for a job as a driver of taxi, he told.

የዘመድ አዝማድ መታጐሪያና ምንም ዓይነት ክርስቲያናዊ ባህሪ የማይታይባቸው ሰዎች እየተሰገሰጉባት እንደሆነች የሚነገርላት የአሁኗ ቤተ-ክህነት በራሷ ልጆች ላይ በር የመዝጋቷ ነገር አገር ጉድ የሚያሰኝ ሆኗል።

The present clergy who's said to be felled with family members and where nothing Christian is being reflected has turned out to be a surprise to many, as she started closing doors upon her own children.    

   ብዙ ጊዜ ደጅ ጠንተው ቤተ-ክህነቱ በዝምድና ፣ በልዩ ጥቅም ትስስር እንጂ ከእውነተኛ ዱኝነት ጋር የተያየዘ መልስ የማይሰጥ የቤተ-ክርስቲያንን ልጆች እያሳደደ ፣ ምንም ዓይነት ቤተ- ክርስቲያናዊ ግንኙት የሌላቸውን ሴት ወንድ በመሰብሰብ የሚገኝ በመሆኑ መከራውና ችግሩ ሲፀናባቸው የግል ሥራም ቢሆን ለመፈለግ ግድ እንዱላቸው ነው ካህኑ የገለፁት።

The priest expressed that it was after waiting patiently for long and seeing that the clergy is collecting people through blood-ties, and relations in terms benefit, not through justice, instead, chasing away children of the church, and gathering males and females who have no role in the church, that it was when the misery reached its climax that he was forced to look for private jobs, the priest expressed.
